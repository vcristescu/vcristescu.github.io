"There are seven beings that are not Gods, that existed before humanity dreamed of Gods, that will exist after the last God is dead. <br />
There are seven beings that exist because, deep in our hearts, we know that they exist. <br />
There are seven beings that are called the Endless. They are, in order of age, Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Desire and Despair, and Delirium, who was once Delight."
